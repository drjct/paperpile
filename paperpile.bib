  abstract  = "Objective: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) continues to prevail
               among very preterm infants. While NICHD BPD Outcome Estimator is
               easy to use, the clinical interpretation remains challenging.
               This study aims to optimize its use. Study Design: A
               retrospective study was conducted with 469 infants born between
               2015 and 2020. Data were entered into the Estimator to obtain
               probability scores. Trajectories of the probability scores were
               modeled using generalized additive modeling. The optimal cutoff
               number for predicting severe BPD or death was identified by a
               grid search from a range established by the original population
               distribution and the ROC curve. Result: Combining probability
               scores from the severe and death categories and the no-BPD and
               mild categories may improve BPD outcome prediction. A cutoff of
               21\% combining outcome probabilities from severe and death
               categories is predictive of severe BPD or death. Conclusion:
               Combining probability scores of different categories improves
               BPD outcome prediction.",

              prematurely born infants are at increased risk because of
              maternal separation in many neonatal intensive care units
              (NICUs). The stress induced from maternal?infant separation can
              lead to well-documented short-term physiologic instability and
              potentially lifelong neurological, sociological, or psychological
              sequelae. Based on previous studies of kangaroo mother care (KMC)
              that demonstrated improvement in physiologic parameters, we
              examined the impact of KMC on physiologic measures of stress
              (abdominal temperature, heart rate, oxygen saturation, perfusion
              index, near-infrared spectrometry), oxidative stress, and energy
              utilization/conservation in preterm infants.Methods:In this
              randomized, stratified study of premature neonates, we compared
              the effects on urinary concentrations of biomarkers of energy
              utilization and oxidative stress of 1 hr of KMC versus incubator
              care on Day 3 of life in intervention-group babies (n = 26) and
              control-group babies (n = 25), respectively. On Day 4, both
              groups received 1 hr of KMC. Urinary samples were collected 3 hr
              before and 3 hr after intervention/incubator care on both days.
              Energy utilization was assessed by measures of adenosine
              triphosphate (ATP) degradation (i.e., hypoxanthine, xanthine, and
              uric acid). Oxidative stress was assessed using urinary
              allantoin. Mixed-models analysis was used to assess differences
              in purine/allantoin.Results:Mean allantoin levels over Days 3 and
              4 were significantly lower in the KMC group than in the control
              group (p = .026).Conclusions:Results provide preliminary evidence
              that KMC reduces neonatal oxidative stress processes and that
              urinary allantoin could serve as an effective noninvasive marker
              for future studies.",

              has seen tremendous amount of growth, thus sparking interest in
              machine learning (ML) within the health care system. OBJECTIVE:
              Our aim for this review is to provide an evidence map of the
              current available evidence on ML in pediatrics and adolescent
              medicine and provide insight for future research. DATA SOURCES: A
              literature search was conducted by using Medline, the Cochrane
              Library, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
              Literature Plus, Web of Science Library, and EBSCO Dentistry \&
              Oral Science Source. STUDY SELECTION: Articles in which an ML
              model was assessed for the diagnosis, prediction, or management
              of any condition in children and adolescents (0--18 years) were
              included. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted for year of
              publication, geographical location, age range, number of
              participants, disease or condition under investigation, study
              methodology, reference standard, type, category, and performance
              of ML algorithms. RESULTS: The review included 363 studies, with
              subspecialties such as psychiatry, neonatology, and neurology
              having the most literature. A majority of the studies were from
              high-income (82\%; n = 296) and upper middle-income countries
              (15\%; n = 56), whereas only 3\% (n = 11) were from low
              middle-income countries. Neural networks and ensemble methods
              were most commonly tested in the 1990s, whereas deep learning and
              clustering emerged rapidly in the current decade. LIMITATIONS:
              Only studies conducted in the English language could be used in
              this review. CONCLUSIONS: The interest in ML has been growing
              across various subspecialties and countries, suggesting a
              potential role in health service delivery for children and
              adolescents in the years to come.",

  abstract = "INTRODUCTION: Approximately 7,000 newborns die every day,
              accounting for almost half of child deaths under 5 years of age.
              Deciphering which neonates are at increased risk for mortality
              can have an important global impact. As such, integrating high
              computational technology (e.g., artificial intelligence [AI]) may
              help identify the early and potentially modifiable predictors of
              neonatal mortality. Therefore, the objective of this study was to
              collate, critically appraise, and analyze neonatal prediction
              studies that included AI. METHODS: A literature search was
              performed in PubMed, Cochrane, OVID, and Google Scholar. We
              included studies that used AI (e.g., machine learning (ML) and
              deep learning) to formulate prediction models for neonatal death.
              We excluded small studies (n < 500 individuals) and studies using
              only antenatal factors to predict mortality. Two independent
              investigators screened all articles for inclusion. The data
              collection consisted of study design, number of models, features
              used per model, feature importance, internal and/or external
              validation, and calibration analysis. Our primary outcome was the
              average area under the receiving characteristic curve (AUC) or
              sensitivity and specificity for all models included in each
              study. RESULTS: Of 434 articles, 11 studies were included. The
              total number of participants was 1.26 M with gestational ages
              ranging from 22 weeks to term. Number of features ranged from 3
              to 66 with timing of prediction as early as 5 min of life to a
              maximum of 7 days of age. The average number of models per study
              was 4, with neural network, random forest, and logistic
              regression comprising the most used models (58.3\%). Five studies
              (45.5\%) reported calibration plots and 2 (18.2\%) conducted
              external validation. Eight studies reported results by AUC and 5
              studies reported the sensitivity and specificity. The AUC varied
              from 58.3\% to 97.0\%. The mean sensitivities ranged from 63\% to
              80\% and specificities from 78\% to 99\%. The best overall model
              was linear discriminant analysis, but it also had a high number
              of features (n = 17). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: ML models can
              accurately predict death in neonates. This analysis demonstrates
              the most commonly used predictors and metrics for AI prediction
              models for neonatal mortality. Future studies should focus on
              external validation, calibration, as well as deployment of
              applications that can be readily accessible to health-care
              providers.",

              indices of cerebral oxygenation and autoregulation in infants
              with critical congenital heart disease in relation to new
              postoperative ischemic brain injury. Methods This prospective,
              clinical cohort included 77 infants with transposition of the
              great arteries (N = 19), left ventricular outflow tract
              obstruction (N = 30), and single ventricle physiology (N = 28)
              undergoing surgery at 30 days or less of life. Postoperative
              near-infrared spectroscopy and physiologic monitoring were
              applied to extract mean arterial blood pressure, regional
              cerebral oxygen saturation, fractional tissue oxygen extraction,
              and regional cerebral oxygen saturation mean arterial blood
              pressure correlation coefficient ($\geq$0.5 considered sign of
              impaired cerebral autoregulation). New postoperative ischemic
              injury was defined as moderate-severe white matter injury or
              focal infarction on magnetic resonance imaging. Low cardiac
              output syndrome was measured as lactate greater than 4 mmol/L
              with pH less than 7.30. Results After surgery, regional cerebral
              oxygen saturation was decreased in all congenital heart disease
              groups with a notable increase in regional cerebral oxygen
              saturation between 6 and 12 hours after surgery, on average with
              a factor of 1.4 (range, 1.1-2.4). Both single ventricle
              physiology and postoperative low cardiac output syndrome were
              associated with lower regional cerebral oxygen saturation and
              increased time with correlation coefficient of 0.5 or greater.
              New postoperative ischemic injury was seen in 39 patients (53\%)
              and equally distributed across congenital heart disease groups.
              Postoperative regional cerebral oxygen saturation, fractional
              tissue oxygen extraction, and correlation coefficient were not
              independently associated with new postoperative white matter
              injury or focal infarction (mixed-model analysis, all F > 0.12).
              Conclusions Postoperative indices of cerebral oxygenation and
              cerebral autoregulation are not independent predictors of new
              ischemic brain injury in infants with critical congenital heart
              disease. Further exploration of the complex interplay among low
              regional cerebral oxygen saturation, low cardiac output syndrome,
              and heart defect is required to identify potential biomarkers
              enabling early intervention for ischemic brain injury.",

              such as constipation, but their effects on baseline contractile
              activity in the gut driven by slow waves is not well established.
              In a video-based gastrointestinal motility monitoring (GIMM)
              system, a mouse's small intestine was placed in Krebs solution
              and recorded using a high definition camera. Untreated controls
              were recorded for each specimen, then treated with a therapeutic
              concentration of the drug, and finally, treated with a
              supratherapeutic dose of the drug. Next, the video clips showing
              gastrointestinal motility were processed, giving us the
              segmentation motions of the intestine, which were then converted
              via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into their respective frequency
              spectrums. These contraction quantifications were analyzed from
              the video recordings under standardised conditions to evaluate
              the effect of drugs. Six experimental trials were included with
              benztropine and promethazine treatments. Only the
              supratherapeutic dose of benztropine was shown to significantly
              decrease the amplitude of contractions; at therapeutic doses of
              both drugs, neither frequency nor amplitude was significantly
              affected. We have demonstrated that intestinal slow waves can be
              analyzed based on the colonic frequency or amplitude at a
              supratherapeutic dose of the anticholinergic medications. More
              research is required on the effects of anticholinergic drugs on

              linear models, which are based on proportionality between two
              variables and/or relationships described by linear differential
              equations. However, nonlinear behavior commonly occurs within
              human systems due to their complex dynamic nature; this cannot be
              described adequately by linear models. Nonlinear thinking has
              grown among physiologists and physicians over the past century,

              assist in interpreting, explaining, and predicting biological
              phenomena. Chaos theory describes elements manifesting behavior
              that is extremely sensitive to initial conditions, does not
              repeat itself and yet is deterministic. Complexity theory goes
              one step beyond chaos and is attempting to explain complex
              behavior that emerges within dynamic nonlinear systems. Nonlinear
              modeling still has not been able to explain all of the complexity
              present in human systems, and further models still need to be
              refined and developed. However, nonlinear modeling is helping to
              explain some system behaviors that linear systems cannot and thus
              will augment our understanding of the nature of complex dynamic

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Multiple studies have documented an increase in weight
              gain after 5 to 10 days of massage therapy for preterm neonates.
              The massaged preterm neonates did not consume more calories than
              the control neonates. One potential mechanism for these effects
              might involve massage-induced increases in vagal activity, which
              in turn may lead to increased gastric motility and thereby weight
              gain. STUDY DESIGN: The present randomized study explored this
              potential underlying mechanism by assessing gastric motility and
              sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system activity in
              response to massage therapy (moderate pressure) versus sham
              massage (light pressure) and control conditions in a group of

              receiving sham massage, preterm neonates receiving massage
              therapy exhibited greater weight gain and increased vagal tone
              and gastric motility during and immediately after treatment.
              Gastric motility and vagal tone during massage therapy were
              significantly related to weight gain. CONCLUSION: The weight gain
              experienced by preterm neonates receiving moderate-pressure
              massage therapy may be mediated by increased vagal activity and

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate whether splanchnic tissue
              oxygen saturation (rsSO2) measured by near-infrared spectroscopy
              (NIRS) could contribute to the early diagnosis of necrotizing
              enterocolitis (NEC). METHODS: We retrospectively included infants
              with suspected NEC, gestational age <32 weeks and/or birth weight
              <1200 g in the first 3 weeks after birth. We calculated mean
              rsSO2, cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (rcSO2), variability of
              rsSO2 (coefficients of variation [rsCoVAR] = SD/mean), and
              splanchnic-cerebral oxygenation ratio ([SCOR] = rsSO2/rcSO2) in
              the period around the abdominal radiograph to confirm or reject
              NEC. RESULTS: Of the 75 infants, 21 (28\%) had NEC (Bell's stage
              $\geq$2). Characteristics of infants with and without NEC
              differed only on mechanical ventilation and nil-per-os status.
              RsSO2 tended to be higher and rcSO2 lower in infants with NEC.
              RsCoVAR (median [range]) was lower (0.11 [0.03-0.34]) vs. 0.20
              [0.01-0.52], P = 0.002) and SCOR higher (0.64 [0.37-1.36]) vs.
              0.47 [0.16-1.09], P = 0.004) in NEC infants. Adjusted for
              postnatal age, mechanical ventilation, and nil-per-os status, a
              0.1 higher rsCoVAR decreased the likelihood of NEC diagnosis with
              likelihood ratio (LR) 0.38 (95\% CI 0.18-0.78) and a 0.1 higher
              SCOR increased it with LR 1.28 (1.02-1.61). CONCLUSIONS: Using
              NIRS, high SCOR may confirm NEC and high variability of rsSO2 may
              rule out NEC, when suspicion arises. IMPACT: Near-infrared
              spectroscopy may contribute to the diagnosis of necrotizing
              enterocolitis. When clinical signs are present a high
              splanchnic-cerebral oxygenation may indicate necrotizing
              enterocolitis. A low splanchnic-cerebral oxygenation ratio and
              high variability of splanchnic tissue oxygen saturation may rule
              out necrotizing enterocolitis. Whether a bedside real-time
              availability of the splanchnic-cerebral oxygenation ratio and

              hypoxic--ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). These neonates received
              hypothermic therapy during the Ô¨Årst 72 h of life while mean
              arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral tissue oxygenation
              saturation (SctO2) were continuously recorded. Wavelet coherence
              analysis, which is a time-frequency domain approach, was used to
              characterize the dynamic relationship between spontaneous
              oscillations in MAP and SctO2. Wavelet-based metrics of phase,
              coherence and gain were derived for quantitative evaluation of
              cerebral autoregulation. We found cerebral autoregulation in
              neonates with HIE was time-scale-dependent in nature.
              SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the spontaneous changes in MAP and SctO2 had
              in-phase coherence at time scales of less than 80 min (b0.0002 Hz
              in frequency), whereas they showed anti-phase coherence at time
              scales of around 2.5 h (~0.0001 Hz in frequency). Both the
              in-phase and anti-phase coherence appeared to be related to worse
              clinical outcomes. These Ô¨Åndings suggest the potential clinical
              use of wavelet coherence analysis to assess dynamic cerebral
              autoregulation in neonatal HIE during hypothermia.",

              leading to significant advances in the last 15 years in

              following the discovery of the central role played by the
              interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). As experimental knowledge of
              ICC physiology has expanded, biophysically based modeling has
              become a valuable tool for integrating experimental data, for
              testing hypotheses on ICC pacemaker mechanisms, and for
              applications in in silico studies including in multiscale models.
              This review is focused on the cellular electrophysiology of ICC.
              Recent evidence from both experimental and modeling domains have
              called aspects of the existing pacemaker theories into question.
              Therefore, current experimental knowledge of ICC pacemaker
              mechanisms is examined in depth, and current theories of ICC
              pacemaking are evaluated and further developed. Existing
              biophysically based ICC models and their physiological
              foundations are then critiqued in light of the recent advances in
              experimental knowledge, and opportunities to improve these models
              are identified. The review concludes by examining several
              potential clinical applications of biophysically based ICC

  abstract = "Arterioles in the peripheral microcirculation are exquisitely
              sensitive to changes in PO2 in their environment: increases in
              PO2 cause vasoconstriction while decreases in PO2 result in
              vasodilatation. However, the cell type that senses O2 (the O2
              sensor) and the signalling pathway that couples changes in PO2 to
              changes in arteriolar tone (the mechanism of action) remain
              unclear. Many (but not all) ex vivo studies of isolated
              cannulated resistance arteries and large, first‚Äêorder arterioles
              support the hypothesis that these vessels are intrinsically
              sensitive to PO2 with the smooth muscle, endothelial cells, or
              red blood cells serving as the O2 sensor. However, in situ
              studies testing these hypotheses in downstream arterioles have
              failed to find evidence of intrinsic O2 sensitivity, and instead
              have supported the idea that extravascular cells sense O2.
              Similarly, ex vivo studies of isolated, cannulated resistance
              arteries and large first‚Äêorder arterioles support the hypotheses
              that O2‚Äêdependent inhibition of production of vasodilator
              cyclooxygenase products or O2‚Äêdependent destruction of nitric
              oxide mediates O2 reactivity of these upstream vessels. In
              contrast, most in vivo studies of downstream arterioles have
              disproved these hypotheses and instead have provided evidence
              supporting the idea that O2‚Äêdependent production of
              vasoconstrictors mediates arteriolar O2 reactivity, with
              significant regional heterogeneity in the specific
              vasoconstrictor involved. Oxygen‚Äêinduced vasoconstriction may
              serve as a protective mechanism to reduce the oxidative burden to
              which a tissue is exposed, a process that is superimposed on top
              of the local mechanisms which regulate tissue blood flow to meet
              a tissue's metabolic demand.",

              normal baseline variability of near-infrared spectroscopy
              (NIRS)-derived regional oxygen saturation (rSO2) are lacking. We
              sought to determine: 1) the quiescent variability of cerebral,
              renal, and splanchnic rSO2 in clinically stable, undisturbed very
              low birth weight neonates and 2) the effects of different data
              averaging epochs on site-specific variability. STUDY DESIGN: In
              this prospective, observational study, neonates between 500 and
              1250 g underwent seven days of continuous, real-time cerebral,
              renal, and splanchnic NIRS monitoring starting within the first
              seventy-two postnatal hours. Demographic, cardiopulmonary,
              bedside care, and rSO2 data were collected. rSO2 variability was
              analyzed utilizing data from quiescent periods identified using
              pre-specified stability criteria. Between- and within-monitoring
              site comparisons of data averaging methods were made utilizing
              ANOVA. RESULT: Twenty-four subjects (GA 27 $\pm$ 0.3 wk, birth
              weight 988 $\pm$ 34 g; mean $\pm$ SEM) were monitored.
              Coefficients of variation (CoVar = SD/mean) were calculated for
              each monitoring site using varied data averaging epochs. CoVar
              was lowest for cerebral, intermediate for renal, and highest for
              splanchnic rSO2 (P < 0.01). For renal and splanchnic sites,
              shorter epochs (5- and 15-min) resulted in significantly smaller
              CoVars [P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively]. Splanchnic
              variability was highly dependent on epoch length, ranging from
              16\% over 5 min to 23\% over 60 min. CONCLUSION: 1) rSO2
              variability differs significantly between monitoring sites and 2)
              shorter data sampling epochs decrease rSO2 variability. These
              observations may assist clinicians in operationally defining

              of physiologic function in humans. The monitoring of splanchnic
              oximetry through the use of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is
              an emerging method used to assess tissue oxygenation status.
              Splanchnic tissue oxygenation (SrSO2) is thought to be
              potentially of high value in critically ill patients because
              gastrointestinal organs can often be the first to suffer ischemic
              injury. During conditions of hypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction, or
              decreased oxygen-carrying capacity, blood flow is diverted toward
              vital organs, such as the brain and the heart at the expense of
              the splanchnic circulation. While monitoring SrSO2 has great
              potential benefit, there are limitations to the technology and
              techniques. SrSO2 has been found to have a relatively high degree
              of variability that can potentially make it difficult to
              interpret. In addition, because splanchnic organs only lie near

              these approaches by building on the empirical JTK\_CYCLE method

              rapidly and accurately detects cycling time series by combining

              the rank order of the time series values. We exploit a publicly

              that BooteJTK provides more consistent rhythm detection than

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Near-infrared spectroscopy is used in the assessment
              of regional splanchnic oxygen saturation (rsSO2), but solid
              reference values are scarce. We aimed to establish reference
              values of rsSO2 for preterm infants during the first week after
              birth, both crude and modeled based on predictors. METHODS: We
              included infants with gestational age (GA) <32 weeks and/or birth
              weight <1200 g. We excluded infants who developed necrotizing
              enterocolitis or sepsis or who died. In the first week after
              birth, we determined a daily 2-h mean of rsSO2 to assess its
              associations with sex, GA, postnatal age (PNA),
              small-for-gestational age (SGA) status, patent ductus arteriosus,
              hemoglobin, nutrition, and head circumference at birth and
              translated those into a prediction model. RESULTS: We included
              220 infants. On day 1, the mean $\pm$ SD rsSO2 value was 48.2\%
              $\pm$ 16.6. The nadir of rsSO2 was on day 4 (38.7\% $\pm$ 16.6
              smoothed line) to 5 (37.4\%$\pm$17.3, actual data), after which
              rsSO2 increased to 44.2\% $\pm$ 16.6 on day 7. The final model of
              the reference values of rsSO2 included the following
              coefficients: rsSO2 = 3.2 - 7.0 $\times$ PNA + 0.8 $\times$ PNA2
              - 4.0 $\times$ SGA + 1.8 $\times$ GA. CONCLUSIONS: We established
              reference values of rsSO2 for preterm infants during the first
              week after birth. GA, PNA, and SGA affect these values and need
              to be taken into account. IMPACT: Regional splanchnic oxygen
              saturation is lower in infants with a lower gestational age and
              in small-for-gestational age infants. Regional splanchnic oxygen
              saturation decreases with a higher postnatal age until day 4
              after birth and then increases until day 7 after birth.
              Gestational age, postnatal age, and small-for-gestational age
              status affect regional splanchnic oxygen saturation and need to
              be taken into account when interpreting regional splanchnic
              oxygen saturations using NIRS. Reference values for infant
              regional splanchnic oxygen saturation can be computed with a
              formula based on these variables, as provided by this study.",

               described by standard techniques such as cosinor analysis.
               Adverse conditions can disturb the regularity and amplitude of
               circadian cycles, and, recently, there is interest in the field
               of chronobiology to quantify irregularities in the circadian
               rhythm as a means to track underlying pathologies. Alterations
               in physiological rhythms over a wide range of frequency scales
               may give additional information on health conditions but are
               often not considered in traditional analyses. Wavelets have been
               introduced to decompose physiological time series in components
               of different frequencies and can quantify irregular patterns,
               but the results may depend on the choice of the mother wavelet
               basis which is arbitrary. An alternative approach are recent
               data-adaptive time-series decomposition techniques, such as
               singular spectrum analysis (SSA), where the basis functions are
               generated by the data itself and are user-independent. In the

              with red blood cell transfusions, many anemic infants are not
              transfused. The implications of this pathophysiologic status,
              especially at times of increased metabolic demand (enteral
              feedings), is not well understood. Near Infrared Spectroscopy
              (NIRS) allows for non-invasive determination of regional oxygen
              saturations (rSO2) in tissues such as the brain and mesentery,
              giving insight into the tissues oxygen sufficiency. OBJECTIVE We
              tested the hypothesis that during enteral feedings, very-low
              birth weight (VLBW) infants with a hematocrit $\leq$ 28\% will
              have a decrease in splanchnic rSO2 and splanchnic cerebral
              oxygenation ratio (SCOR). METHODS This prospective,
              observational, two-centered study, included VLBW infants
              receiving full enteral feedings with a hematocrit $\leq$ 28\%.
              Cerebral and splanchnic rSO2 were monitored via NIRS for 24
              hours. Average values were calculated for periods immediately
              preceding, during, and after each feeding. SCOR was calculated
              from these values (rSO2 splanchnic/rSO2 cerebral), and data was
              analyzed using a linear mixed effect model. RESULTS Fifty
              neonates with a median gestational age of 28 weeks (range,
              23--32), a birth weight of 1118$\pm$284g (mean$\pm$s.d.), and a
              hematocrit of 26$\pm$2\% (mean$\pm$s.d.) were studied. During
              feedings, SCOR decreased significantly from baseline
              (0.72$\pm$0.17 to 0.69$\pm$0.17; p=0.043). With feedings there
              was a trend of decreased splanchnic rSO2 (47$\pm$11 to 45$\pm$10;
              p=0.057), and no change in cerebral rSO2 (66$\pm$8 to 66$\pm$7,
              p=0.597). CONCLUSIONS VLBW infants with a hematocrit $\leq$ 28\%
              had a decrease in SCOR and a trend towards decreased splanchnic

              measurement of GI transit is needed to establish an accurate
              diagnosis. Similarly, since symptoms originating from one part of
              the gut may overlap with symptoms from another, localizing
              transit abnormality to one organ vs. another using direct
              measurement is an important part of diagnostic evaluations.
              Consequently, noninvasive tests of GI transit should be done

              measure transit accurately; results of transit tests often depend

              research is to devise a noninvasive method of early detection. We
              hypothesized that abdominal near-infrared spectroscopy (A-NIRS)
              readings will identify impending NEC in a large animal model.
              METHODS: Piglets were prematurely delivered and received
              parenteral nutrition followed by enteral feedings. Serial A-NIRS
              readings were obtained for 5 days, and animals were monitored for
              NEC. Separately, A-NIRS readings were obtained in healthy piglets
              to validate the correlation of A-NIRS with splanchnic oxygen
              delivery. RESULTS: Of 29 piglets, 3 developed NEC. Eleven piglets
              without NEC died prematurely. Fifteen piglets remained healthy,
              had normal histologic assessment of their intestines, and served
              as controls. Abdominal near-infrared spectroscopy readings within
              12 hours of birth were significantly lower in animals that
              developed NEC compared with healthy littermates (4\% vs 33\%, P =
              .02). For all time-points measured, A-NIRS readings were
              significantly lower in the NEC group compared with controls (21\%
              vs 55\%, P < .001). Abdominal near-infrared spectroscopy readings
              correlated with both decreased pulse oximetry readings during
              apneic episodes (r = 0.96) and increased superior mesenteric
              artery flow in response to glucagon-like peptide 2 (r = 0.67).
              CONCLUSION: Abdominal near-infrared spectroscopy is capable of
              detecting alterations in intestinal oxygenation and perfusion in
              neonatal piglets and may allow early detection of neonates at
              risk for NEC.",

  abstract = "Background: The number of subjects that can be recruited in
              immunological studies and the number of immunological parameters
              that can be measured has increased rapidly over the past decade
              and is likely to continue to expand. Large and complex
              immunological datasets can now be used to investigate complex
              scientific questions, but to make the most of the potential in
              such data and to get the right answers sophisticated statistical
              approaches are necessary. Such approaches are used in many other
              scientific disciplines, but immunological studies on the whole
              still use simple statistical techniques for data analysis.
              Results: The paper provides an overview of the range of
              statistical methods that can be used to answer different
              immunological study questions. We discuss specific aspects of
              immunological studies and give examples of typical scientific
              questions related to immunological data. We review classical
              bivariate and multivariate statistical techniques (factor
              analysis, cluster analysis, discriminant analysis) and more
              advanced methods aimed to explore causal relationships (path

              application to immunological data. We show the main features of
              each method, the type of study question they can answer, the type
              of data they can be applied to, the assumptions required for each

  abstract = "As the function of the gastrointestinal tract is to a large
              degree mechanical, it has become increasingly popular to acquire
              distensibility data in motility research based on various
              parameters. Hence it is important to know on which geometrical
              and mechanical assumptions the various parameters are based.
              Currently, compliance and tone derived from pressure-volume
              curves are by far the most often used parameters. However,
              pressure-volume relations obtained in tubular organs must be
              carefully interpreted as they provide no direct measure of
              luminal cross-sectional area and other variables useful in plane
              stress and strain analysis. Thus, erroneous conclusions
              concerning tissue distensibility may be deduced. Other
              parameters, such as wall tension, stress and strain, give more
              useful information about mechanical behaviour. Distensibility
              data procure significance in fluid mechanics and in the study of
              tone, peristaltic reflexes, and mechanoreceptor kinematics. Such
              data are needed for the determination of the interaction between
              stimulus, electrical responses in neurons and the mechanical
              behaviour of the gut. Furthermore, from a clinical perspective,
              investigation of visco-elastic properties is important because GI
              diseases are associated with growth and remodelling. For example,
              prestenotic dilatation, increased collagen synthesis, dysmotility
              and altered distensibility are common features of obstructive
              diseases. The purpose of this review is to discuss the
              physiological and clinical importance of acquiring biomechanical
              data, distensibility parameters and interpretation of these
              results and their associated errors. We will also discuss some
              aspects of the relationship between morphology, growth and
              biomechanics. Finally, we will outline a number of techniques to
              study the mechanical properties of the GI tract.",

              the many reported factors associated with NEC is needed to enable
              identification of neonates at risk for NEC. The aim was to
              systematically review the literature to identify independent risk
              factors for NEC from the literature. METHODS: Medline, Cochrane,
              Embase, Pubmed and Google Scholar were searched systematically
              for cohort studies reporting prognostic factors for NEC in
              neonates using multivariable analysis. Studies were scored with
              the Quality In Prognosis Studies tool (QUIPS). RESULTS: From 5154
              initial hits, 14 prognostic studies were included, with various
              designs. Study quality was rated high in three studies, moderate
              or low in the 11 others. Significant prognostic factors for NEC
              reported in at least two studies were: low birth weight, small
              for gestational age, low gestational age, assisted ventilation,
              premature rupture of membranes, black ethnicity, sepsis, outborn,
              hypotension (all increased risk), surfactant therapy (conflicting
              results) and cesarean section (lower risk). Meta-analysis was
              considered not feasible. CONCLUSION: High quality studies on
              prognostic factors for NEC are rare. Several prognostic factors,
              that are not necessarily causal, are associated with NEC. High
              quality prognostic research is necessary to establish the

              to continuously and noninvasively monitor intestinal function.
              This technology may be valuable because among neonates,
              intestinal maturity is highly variable and difficult to assess
              based solely on clinical signs. The aim of this study was to
              determine if there is an association between NIRS-based StO2
              measurements and peristaltic activity assessed by transabdominal
              ultrasonography (US). MATERIAL/METHODS: Nineteen neonates of
              gestational age >32 weeks were categorized according to
              ``no/low'' versus ``normal/hyperactive'' motility levels, based
              on blinded US scan results. StO2 was recorded every 2 s for 24 h,
              following the ultrasound recording. Differences between the
              resulting estimates of average StO2 (bias of fits) and
              goodness-of-fit (residuals) were evaluated. RESULTS: Newborns
              with normal/hyperactive motility had higher mean StO2 than
              newborns with no/low motility (72.3$\pm$4.4 vs. 65.5$\pm$7.9,
              p<0.05, F=5.65). Residual errors were not significantly different
              between the 2 groups (p=0.213, F=0.213). A multivariate linear
              regression model using the means, residuals, and pairwise
              products of both, demonstrated more significant separation
              (0.47$\pm$0.26 vs. -0.24$\pm$0.33, p<0.01, F=27.4). A non-linear

              association between NIRS-based StO2 measurements and peristaltic
              activity visualized by ultrasound imaging. NIRS may offer a

  abstract = "CONTEXT: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a non-invasive
              bedside monitor of tissue oxygenation that may be a useful
              clinical tool in monitoring of gut oxygenation in newborn
              infants. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review literature to
              determine whether NIRS is a reliable tool to monitor gut
              oxygenation on neonatal units. DATA SOURCES: PubMed and Embase
              databases were searched using the terms 'neonate', 'preterm
              infants', 'NIRS' and 'gut oxygenation' (2001-2018). STUDY
              SELECTION: Studies were included if they met inclusion criteria
              (clinical trial, observational studies, neonatal population,
              articles in English and reviewing regional gut oxygen
              saturations) and exclusion criteria (not evaluating abdominal
              NIRS or regional oxygen saturations). DATA EXTRACTION: Two
              authors independently searched PubMed and Embase using the
              predefined terms, appraised study quality and extracted from 30
              studies the study design and outcome data. LIMITATIONS: Potential
              for publication bias, majority of studies were prospective cohort
              studies and small sample sizes. RESULTS: Thirty studies were
              reviewed assessing the validity of abdominal NIRS and potential
              application in neonates. Studies reviewed assessed abdominal NIRS
              in different settings including normal neonates, bolus and
              continuous feeding, during feed intolerance, necrotising
              enterocolitis and transfusion with packed red cells. Several
              observational studies demonstrated how NIRS could be used in
              clinical practice. CONCLUSIONS: NIRS may prove to be a useful
              bedside tool on the neonatal unit, working alongside current
              clinical tools in the monitoring of newborn infants (preterm and
              term) and inform clinical management. We recommend further
              studies including randomised controlled trials looking at
              specific measurements and cut-offs for abdominal NIRS for use in
              further clinical practice.",

              preoperative and postoperative values within each CHD group.
              Methods Frequency-domain near-infrared spectroscopy and diffuse
              correlation spectroscopy were used to measure cerebral oxygen
              saturation, cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow index,
              cerebral oxygen extraction fraction (OEF, calculated using
              arterial oxygen saturation and cerebral oxygen saturation), and
              an index of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption in
              control and CHD neonates. Preoperative CHD measures were compared
              with controls. Preoperative and postoperative measures were
              compared within each CHD group. Results In total, 31 CHD neonates
              (7 two-ventricle, 11 TGA, 13 SV) and 13 controls were included.
              Only neonates with SV CHD displayed significantly lower
              preoperative cerebral blood flow index (P < .04) than controls.
              TGA and SV groups displayed greater OEF (P < .05) during the

              non-independent observations or aggregated data; this may produce

              differing patterns between-participants versus
              within-participants. Unlike simple regression/correlation, rmcorr
              does not violate the assumption of independence of observations.
              Also, rmcorr tends to have much greater statistical power because
              neither averaging nor aggregation is necessary for an
              intra-individual research question. Rmcorr estimates the common
              regression slope, the association shared among individuals. To

              cerebral palsy, and death. The pathophysiology is not well
              defined, but damage to the fragile germinal matrix vasculature
              may be due to free radicals generated during inflammation and as
              a consequence of ischemia followed by reperfusion. Assessment of
              the oxidative stress status in these infants is therefore
              important. Urinary allantoin concentration was measured in

              IVH. Urine was collected from 44 preterm neonates at four time
              points between 24 and 72 hours of life (HOL), and the allantoin
              content was determined by gas chromatography mass spectrometry
              (GCMS). Records were retrospectively reviewed, and the incidence
              and severity of IVH was categorized as follows: no IVH (n = 24),
              mild (grade 1--2) IVH (n = 13), and severe (grade 3--4) IVH (n =
              7). Neonates with severe IVH showed significantly elevated
              allantoin levels vs subjects with no IVH from 36 HOL (0.098 $\pm$

              0.002). The allantoin concentration remained elevated even at 72

              in allantoin levels in the no IVH and mild IVH groups. IVH was
              diagnosed by head imaging on average at about 11th postnatal day.
              Urinary allantoin levels were significantly elevated during the
              first 3 days of life in the neonates subsequently diagnosed with
              severe IVH, suggesting that oxidative stress might be a crucial

  abstract = "In the absence of effective interventions to prevent preterm
              births, improved survival of infants who are born at the
              biological limits of viability has relied on advances in
              perinatal care over the past 50 years. Except for extremely
              preterm infants with suboptimal perinatal care or major antenatal
              events that cause severe respiratory failure at birth, most
              extremely preterm infants now survive, but they often develop
              chronic lung dysfunction termed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD;
              also known as chronic lung disease). Despite major efforts to
              minimize injurious but often life-saving postnatal interventions
              (such as oxygen, mechanical ventilation and corticosteroids), BPD
              remains the most frequent complication of extreme preterm birth.
              BPD is now recognized as the result of an aberrant reparative
              response to both antenatal injury and repetitive postnatal injury
              to the developing lungs. Consequently, lung development is
              markedly impaired, which leads to persistent airway and pulmonary
              vascular disease that can affect adult lung function. Greater
              insights into the pathobiology of BPD will provide a better
              understanding of disease mechanisms and lung repair and
              regeneration, which will enable the discovery of novel
              therapeutic targets. In parallel, clinical and translational
              studies that improve the classification of disease phenotypes and
              enable early identification of at-risk preterm infants should
              improve trial design and individualized care to enhance outcomes

  abstract = "Prediction models are developed to aid health care providers in
              estimating the probability or risk that a specific disease or
              condition is present (diagnostic models) or that a specific event
              will occur in the future (prognostic models), to inform their
              decision making. However, the overwhelming evidence shows that
              the quality of reporting of prediction model studies is poor.
              Only with full and clear reporting of information on all aspects
              of a prediction model can risk of bias and potential usefulness
              of prediction models be adequately assessed. The Transparent
              Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual
              Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) Initiative developed a set of
              recommendations for the reporting of studies developing,
              validating, or updating a prediction model, whether for
              diagnostic or prognostic purposes. This article describes how the
              TRIPOD Statement was developed. An extensive list of items based
              on a review of the literature was created, which was reduced
              after a Web-based survey and revised during a 3-day meeting in
              June 2011 with methodologists, health care professionals, and
              journal editors. The list was refined during several meetings of
              the steering group and in e-mail discussions with the wider group
              of TRIPOD contributors. The resulting TRIPOD Statement is a
              checklist of 22 items, deemed essential for transparent reporting
              of a prediction model study. The TRIPOD Statement aims to improve
              the transparency of the reporting of a prediction model study
              regardless of the study methods used. The TRIPOD Statement is
              best used in conjunction with the TRIPOD explanation and
              elaboration document. To aid the editorial process and readers of

  abstract = "Cardiac point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is increasingly being
              utilized in neonatal intensive care units to provide information
              in real time to aid clinical decision making. While training
              programs and scope of practice have been well defined for other
              specialties, such as adult critical care and emergency medicine,
              there is a lack of structure for neonatal cardiac POCUS. A more
              comprehensive and advanced hemodynamic evaluation by a
              neonatologist has previously published its own clinical
              guidelines and specific rigorous training programs have been
              established to achieve competency in neonatal hemodynamics.
              However, it is becoming increasingly evident that access and
              training for basic cardiac assessment by ultrasound enhances
              bedside clinical care for specific indications. Recently, expert
              consensus POCUS guidelines for use in neonatal and pediatric
              intensive care endorsed by the European Society of Pediatric and
              Neonatal Intensive Care (ESPNIC) have been published to guide the
              clinicians in using POCUS for specific indications, though the
              line between cardiac POCUS and advanced hemodynamic evaluation
              remains somewhat fluid.Conclusion: This article is focused on
              neonatal cardiac POCUS and its evolution, value, and limitations
              in the modern neonatal clinical practice. Cardiac POCUS can
              provide physiological and hemodynamic information in making
              clinical decisions while dealing with neonatal emergencies.
              However, it should be applied only for the specific indications
              and should be performed by a clinician trained in cardiac POCUS.
              There is an urgent need of developing cardiac POCUS curriculum
              and certification to support a widespread and safe use in
              neonates. What is Known: ‚Ä¢ International training guidelines and
              curriculum have been published for neonatologist-performed
              echocardiography (NPE) or targeted neonatal echocardiography
              (TNE). ‚Ä¢ International evidence-based guidelines for use of point
              of care ultrasound (POCUS) in neonates and children have been
              recently published. What is New: ‚Ä¢ Cardiac POCUS is increasingly
              being incorporated in neonatal practice for emergency situations.
              However, one must be aware of its specific indications and
              limitations, especially for the neonatal clinical practice. ‚Ä¢
              Cardiac POCUS and NPE/TNE are continuum of cardiac imaging with
              different indications and training requirements.",

              adequately predict childhood morbidity.Objectives: To determine
              which of 18 prespecified, revised definitions of bronchopulmonary
              dysplasia that variably define disease severity according to the
              level of respiratory support and supplemental oxygen administered
              at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age best predicts death or serious
              respiratory morbidity through 18-26 months' corrected
              age.Methods: We assessed infants born at less than 32 weeks of
              gestation between 2011 and 2015 at 18 centers of the Eunice
              Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human
              Development Neonatal Research Network.Measurements and Main
              Results: Of 2,677 infants, 683 (26\%) died or developed serious
              respiratory morbidity. The diagnostic criteria that best
              predicted this outcome defined bronchopulmonary dysplasia
              according to treatment with the following support at 36 weeks'
              postmenstrual age, regardless of prior or current oxygen therapy:
              no bronchopulmonary dysplasia, no support (n = 773); grade 1,
              nasal cannula $\leq$2 L/min (n = 1,038); grade 2, nasal cannula
              >2 L/min or noninvasive positive airway pressure (n = 617); and
              grade 3, invasive mechanical ventilation (n = 249). These
              criteria correctly predicted death or serious respiratory
              morbidity in 81\% of study infants. Rates of this outcome
              increased stepwise from 10\% among infants without
              bronchopulmonary dysplasia to 77\% among those with grade 3
              disease. A similar gradient (33-79\%) was observed for death or
              neurodevelopmental impairment.Conclusions: The definition of
              bronchopulmonary dysplasia that best predicted early childhood
              morbidity categorized disease severity according to the mode of

  abstract = "Limited sample sizes can lead to spurious modeling findings in
              biomedical research. The objective of this work is to present a
              new method to generate synthetic populations (SPs) from limited
              samples using matched case-control data (n = 180 pairs),
              considered as two separate limited samples. SPs were generated
              with multivariate kernel density estimations (KDEs) with
              unconstrained bandwidth matrices. We included four continuous
              variables and one categorical variable for each individual.
              Bandwidth matrices were determined with Differential Evolution
              (DE) optimization by covariance comparisons. Four synthetic
              samples (n = 180) were derived from their respective SPs.
              Similarity between observed samples with synthetic samples was
              compared assuming their empirical probability density functions
              (EPDFs) were similar. EPDFs were compared with the maximum mean
              discrepancy (MMD) test statistic based on the Kernel Two-Sample
              Test. To evaluate similarity within a modeling context, EPDFs
              derived from the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) scores and
              residuals were summarized with the distance to the model in
              X-space (DModX) as additional comparisons. Four SPs were
              generated from each sample. The probability of selecting a
              replicate when randomly constructing synthetic samples (n = 180)
              was infinitesimally small. MMD tests indicated that the observed
              sample EPDFs were similar to the respective synthetic EPDFs. For
              the samples, PCA scores and residuals did not deviate
              significantly when compared with their respective synthetic
              samples. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated by
              producing synthetic data at the individual level, statistically
              similar to the observed samples. The methodology coupled KDE with
              DE optimization and deployed novel similarity metrics derived
              from PCA. This approach could be used to generate larger-sized
              synthetic samples. To develop this approach into a research tool
              for data exploration purposes, additional evaluation with
              increased dimensionality is required. Moreover, given a fully
              specified population, the degree to which individuals can be
              discarded while synthesizing the respective population accurately
              will be investigated. When these objectives are addressed,
              comparisons with other techniques such as bootstrapping will be
              required for a complete evaluation.",

              impairment (NDI) in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants at
              18 to 26 months with early hypoxemic respiratory failure (HRF).
              We also assessed whether African American infants with early HRF
              had improved outcomes after exposure to inhaled nitric oxide
              (iNO). METHODS: ELBW infants $\leq$1000 g and gestational age
              $\leq$26 weeks with maximal oxygen $\geq$60\% on either day 1 or
              day 3 were labeled as ``early HRF'' and born between 2007 and
              2015 in the Neonatal Research Network were included. Using a
              propensity score regression model, we analyzed outcomes and
              effects of exposure to iNO overall and separately by race.
              RESULTS: Among 7639 ELBW infants born $\leq$26 weeks, 22.7\% had
              early HRF. Early HRF was associated with a mortality of 51.3\%.
              The incidence of moderate-severe NDI among survivors was 41.2\%
              at 18 to 26 months. Mortality among infants treated with iNO was
              59.4\%. Female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.4, 95\%
              confidence interval [CI]: 1.8-3.3), birth weight $\geq$720 g
              (aOR: 2.3, 95\% CI: 1.7-3.1) and complete course of antenatal
              steroids (aOR: 1.6, 95\% CI: 1.1-2.2) were associated with intact
              survival. African American infants had a similar incidence of
              early HRF (21.7\% vs 23.3\%) but lower exposure to iNO (16.4\% vs
              21.6\%). Among infants with HRF exposed to iNO, intact survival
              (no death or NDI) was not significantly different between African
              American and other races (aOR: 1.5, 95\% CI: 0.6-3.6).
              CONCLUSIONS: Early HRF in infants $\leq$26 weeks' gestation is
              associated with high mortality and NDI at 18 to 26 months. Use of
              iNO did not decrease mortality or NDI. Outcomes following iNO
              exposure were not different in African American infants.",

              survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) for preterm
              African American infants. STUDY DESIGN: An individual participant
              data meta-analysis was conducted, including 3 randomized,
              placebo-controlled trials that enrolled infants born at 5 parts
              per million with the intention to treat for 7 days minimum. The
              primary outcome was a composite of death or BPD. Secondary
              outcomes included death before discharge, postnatal steroid use,
              gross pulmonary air leak, pulmonary hemorrhage, measures of
              respiratory support, and duration of hospital stay. RESULTS:
              Compared with other races, African American infants had a
              significant reduction in the composite outcome of death or BPD
              with iNO treatment: 49\% treated vs 63\% controls (relative risk,
              0.77; 95\% CI, 0.65-0.91; P = .003; interaction P = .016). There
              were no differences between racial groups for death. There was
              also a significant difference between races (interaction P =
              .023) of iNO treatment for BPD in survivors, with the greatest
              effect in African American infants (P = .005). There was no
              difference between racial groups in the use of postnatal
              steroids, pulmonary air leak, pulmonary hemorrhage, or other
              measures of respiratory support. CONCLUSION: iNO therapy should
              be considered for preterm African American infants at high risk
              for BPD. iNO to prevent BPD in African Americans may represent an
              example of a racially customized therapy for infants.",
